# V0-AWD-Tim-Style
Quad motor v0 XY with tensioner

This design was inspired by Coconut & FailFast

Materials needed:

-random filament (I used CF PETG, ABS will do fine) 

-1 printed Top

-1 printed Bottom

-2 printed Uspacers

-28 F623ZZ Flanged Ball Bearing 3x10x4mm (If you print the stock 9mm spacers you don't need as many)

-28 3x5x0.5 mm Shim Spacer Washers

-23 M3x35 Bolts

-8 M3x8-10-12 (I don't remember what exactly I used but one of those)

-4 GT2 20t pulleys 5mm bore

-4 nema 17 steppers of your choice

-4 heatset inserts

-stock y endstop switch & screws

-5 mm GT2 belt width 6mm

-control board that supports at least 6 stepper drivers (I'm using a btt octopus)

Assembly:

Just put it together, if you're building this I trust you.

Tensioning:

When initially installing belts you can leave the slotted center idler loose, 
once belt is installed you can push idler from the build volume side until tensioned
as desired and tighen.

Klipper config:

you'll need to add a stepper_x1 and stepper_y1 with proper pinout and coresponding driver section,
I'll provide my current config in this folder
