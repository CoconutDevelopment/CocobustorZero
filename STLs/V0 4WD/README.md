How to choose a awd

Awd TE (Tim edition) and Awd CE (Coconut edition) are very similar in their design, they both have top and bottom motor plates and tensioners.
The difference between them is coconut awd keeps the belt path straight and uses the motors themselves to tension (using an m5 screw) but it uses 4 more idlers (8 more bearings) than tim edition, and is optimized for maximum grip on the motor pulley. While Tim edition uses the middle idler to tension the belts and may not have as much grip.

Please make an imformed descision and this is biased as it is written by coconut, timtim has allowed me to use his files on this repo but you can also visit his own.
Also note that the text above is in referenace to AWD v2 CE, awd v1 does not have tensioners and is no longer maintained.

If you have questions please ask me on the voron discord in the v0 user mods channel (Coconut #1567) Thank you!
